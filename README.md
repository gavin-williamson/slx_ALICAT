# slx_ALICAT

## About
slx_ALICAT is a simple toolbox that enables interaction with ALICAT devices. The toolbox can be used to read and control ALICAT mass flow, pressure, BASIS, and CODA controllers/meters over serial communication in Simulink. This toolbox aims to be as user-friendly as possible, so that users can quickly set up Simulink models to read and command ALICAT devices. The toolbox is quite powerful, however, and can communicate with multiple ALICATs simultaneously, is compatible with several different ALICAT devices, and provides access to Simulink & MATLAB's extensive library of control & processing functionality.

Much of the functionality in this toolbox is implemented in base Simulink, so speed/determinism is not guaranteed, and this has not been tested with Simulink real-time products.
